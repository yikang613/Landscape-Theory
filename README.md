# Landscape-Theory

Findings by M. L. Lyra, S. Mayboroda and M. Filoche relate invertibility and positivity of
a class of discrete Schrodinger matrices with the existence of the “Landscape Function,” which
provides an upper bound on all eigenvectors simultaneously. Their argument is based on the
variational principles. We consider an alternative method of proving these results, based on
the power series expansion of matrices, and demonstrate that it naturally extends the original
findings to the case of long range operators.
